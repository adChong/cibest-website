**IDEASLab (Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation)** is an interdisciplinary research group based at the National University of Singapore. 

We are driven by the mission to reshape how buildings in the tropics are cooled, controlled, and experienced through sustainable, adaptive, and occupant-centered strategies. Rooted in building science and engineering, our work goes beyond isolated innovations to deliver scalable, practical, and energy-efficient solutions for the tropics through climate-responsive design, innovative building technologies, and smart building operations.

Guided by total building performance principles, we take a systems-integration perspective to ensure our research is coherent, performance-driven, and ready for real-world application. By developing context-sensitive, occupant-responsive, and performance-informed solutions, we aim to enable climate-responsive, energy-efficient, and high-performing buildings in the tropics.
