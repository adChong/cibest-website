**IDEASLab (Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation)** is an interdisciplinary research group based at the National University of Singapore. 

We are driven by the mission to reshape how buildings in the tropics are cooled, controlled, and experienced through sustainable, adaptive, and occupant-centered strategies. Rooted in building science and engineering, our work goes beyond isolated innovations to deliver scalable, practical, and energy-efficient solutions for the tropics through climate-responsive design, innovative building technologies, and smart building operations.

Guided by total building performance principles, we take a systems-integration perspective to ensure our research is coherent, performance-driven, and ready for real-world application. By developing context-sensitive, occupant-responsive, and performance-informed solutions, we aim to enable climate-responsive, energy-efficient, and high-performing buildings in the tropics.

We are guided by a set of principles that define how we work and what we stand for:

- **Impact through Integration** – We bridge research and application, ensuring our work delivers measurable benefits in real-world tropical building contexts.  
- **Collaboration** – We work across disciplines and with industry and government to co-create solutions.  
- **Rigor and Relevance** – We combine scientific depth with engineering practicality to produce solutions that are both credible and scalable.  
- **Adaptability** – We design with flexibility in mind, recognizing that effective solutions must evolve with changing climates, technologies, and user needs.

**Our Lab Culture**

We work in a flat, non-hierarchical environment where ideas are valued regardless of role or seniority. Open communication is central to how we operate, and we maintain an honest, open culture where feedback is part of learning and growth, never personal. We foster mutual respect and trust, supporting one another’s growth and contributions, and we believe in fair recognition, ensuring contributions are acknowledged appropriately and credit is given where it is due.
