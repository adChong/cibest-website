Dr. Adrian Chong is an Associate Professor in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) and a Fellow of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA). He leads the Integrated Data, Energy Analysis and Simulation (IDEAS) lab, an interdisciplinary group addressing the multi-faceted challenges of optimizing building energy efficiency and performance. As a principal investigator, he has successfully secured research projects with total funding exceeding 8 million Singapore dollars. His research challenges conventional approaches to cooling and comfort in tropical buildings, advancing sustainable, adaptive, and data-driven alternatives to conventional building systems and operations. Adrian also serves as a subject editor for [Building Simulation](https://www.springer.com/journal/12273), an editorial board member for [Energy and Buildings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-and-buildings), and an Early Career Board Member for [Building and Environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/building-and-environment).
