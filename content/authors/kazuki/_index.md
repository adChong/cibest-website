Kazuki Horikoshi is a PhD student in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg). His research focuses on integrating advanced AI techniques—including transfer learning, active learning, and reinforcement learning—into building systems to enhance operational efficiency and improve occupant comfort.
He addresses the challenge of designing occupant-centric HVAC control strategies that balance energy performance with individual comfort needs, using both field data and building performance simulations (e.g., EnergyPlus).
A key focus of his work is on room occupancy resolution and tracking at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and using this information to enable more responsive and energy-efficient control.
Prior to joining NUS, he worked as a mechanical system engineer and a BIM manager at [Nihon Sekkei](https://www.nihonsekkei.co.jp/?lang=en) and served as an AI Project Manager in HEROZ[HEROZ](https://heroz.co.jp/en/), where he gained hands-on experience in both building design and applied AI development. This unique background enables him to bridge the gap between industry practice and academic research.
