Wei Liang is a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg) and a professional mechanical engineer licensed in the State of California, USA. His research interests include robotic and IoT applications for building management, building performance modeling, and building controls and diagnostics. Before joining the IDEAS lab, he obtained his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University. He also worked as an HVAC design engineer and an energy modeler in an MEP/FP firm in San Francisco for four years. His multi-disciplinary background in engineering and research equips him with a unique perspective on building performance and diagnostics, motivating him to explore comprehensive and integrated solutions in building science and technology.
