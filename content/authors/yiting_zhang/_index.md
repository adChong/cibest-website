Yiting Zhang is a PhD student in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg), where she develops data-driven surrogates to enhance building performance simulation. She currently focuses on modeling complex building systems and operations—such as suspended radiant cooling panels (RCPs)—to accurately predict behavior and enhance heat-transfer efficiency and structural integrity. Prior to NUS, she was a master intern at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, supporting modeling and field validation of cold-climate heat pump prototypes and direct expansion equipment.
