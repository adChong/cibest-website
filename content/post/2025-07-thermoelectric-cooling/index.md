Climate change is driving up energy use, especially for cooling buildings. While effective, traditional air-conditioning systems consume large amounts of energy and use refrigerants that contribute to global warming. In collaboration with **Surbana Jurong Pte Ltd** and **Kajima Corporation**, this project will develop a portable thermoelectric cooling system for naturally ventilated (NV) and mixed-mode ventilated (MMV) spaces, reducing reliance on air-conditioning and reserving its use as a last resort.

The system leverages thermoelectric cooling technology to deliver targeted, localised comfort—significantly cutting the need for full-space air-conditioning. It integrates advanced materials such as phase change material (PCM) composites and high-swelling hydrogels with forced air convection to manage heat and moisture efficiently. Designed to be portable, it can be adapted for a wide range of building types.

Aligned with Singapore’s Green Building Masterplan, this project supports the nation’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 by cooling only when and where necessary. Beyond Singapore, it holds strong potential for tropical cities across Southeast Asia facing similar climate and urbanisation challenges.
