A new project *Cost-Effective Wireless Occupant-Centric Controls for Energy-Efficient Whole Building Retrofit*, led by **Resync Technologies** with co-PIs from **NUS** and **A*STAR**, has been awarded **S$1.256 million** in funding under the **BCA Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) R&D Programme**.

The project will develop and demonstrate a **cost-effective, wireless occupant-centric control system** that dynamically adapts whole-building air-conditioning, ventilation, and lighting systems based on predicted occupancy patterns and counts. By combining **multimodal sensing**, **domain adaptation techniques**, and **robust predictive controls**, the team aims to create scalable solutions that enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort in existing buildings. The full-scale demonstration will take place at the **NUS Ventus building**.

Alongside lead PI **Jayantika Soni** (Resync Technologies), the project team includes co-PIs **{{% mention "adrian_chong" %}}** (IDEASLab, NUS), **Bertrand Lasternas** (University Campus Infrastructure, NUS), and **Wu Keyu** (Institute for Infocomm Research, A\*STAR), as well as collaborators **Daniel Wong** (NUS) and **Chen Zhenghua** (Institute for Infocomm Research, A\*STAR).

Working closely across research and industry, the team aims to deliver occupant-centric control strategies ready for real-world application.
